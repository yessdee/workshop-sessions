= Introduction to Automotive and CAN
Version 0.5

== Preface

=== Prologue

* This document is more an automotive jargon buster.

* Represents terms to be known for working at automotive

* Expected that audience go through the terms and get the details by
  their own.

* Most of the information are available in Wikipedia, Certain
  representational links are also added, to narrow down the audience
  to focus on the key areas.

== Automotive 

=== Automotive Devices

In a vehicle there are numerous electronic devices available in which

* Few are mandatory and others are for comfort.

* Few devices are hidden inside the body and few are visible

* Few add's up for vehicular features and some for user experience.

* Few for safety and few for luxury

=== Automotive Primitive Devices

These devices are mandatory and exists in every devices.

* Electronic Control Unit (ECU)

* Electronic Instrument Cluster

=== Automotive Supplementary Devices

These devices are there to improve the comfort and driving experience

* Automotive Head Units (AHU) 

* In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI)

* Telematics Control Unit (TCU)

* Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)
  - Heads-Up Display (HUD)

=== Automotive Integrated Devices

* Integrated Cockpits

  - Is like having IVI, Clusters & ADAS together as same device.

=== Automotive Features for Future

These are upcoming features

* Autonomous Driving

* Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V)/ Vehicle to Roadside (V2R) / (V2X)

== Devices in Detail

=== Electronic Control Unit (ECU)

These are elementary devices stays invisible from outside, which
monitors and controls the electro-mechanic parts of the car. Some of
the ECU types are

 * Engine Control Module (ECM)

 * Power-train Control Module (PCM)

 * Brake Control Module (BM)

 * Transmission Control Unit (TCU)

 * Suspension Control Module (SCM)

 * Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)

 * Electronic Power Steering (EPS) 

 * Body Control Modules (BCM)

=== Instrument Cluster

This panel which stays behind the steering and gives user several
vehicular control and information 

* Major Types 
  - Digital with a LCD Panel and a Graphical HMI
  - Analogue with dials and Gauges

* It has several metrical features like 
  - Speedometer, Tachometer and Odometer
  - Fuel Gauge and Oil temperature gauge 

* Telltales (Warnings & Indicators)
  - turn
  - seat-belt warning
  - engine malfunction

=== In Vehicle Infotainment

Initially car had only vehicle audio system, later they were added
standard interfaces and size specifications, it was called as
automotive head-unit(AHU).

The AHU were added with much more features to provide more
information like location, phone sync to user, where the infotainment
(information + entertainment) devices born.

=== Telematics Devices

This devices when added to the vehicle makes it to be a connected
device, where the vehicle can be monitored and controlled from remote
machine.

=== ADAS

* Advanced Driver Assistance Systems the automotive devices which
  helps in improving the driving experience and road safety.

* Some of the features are supported in cluster and some are in
  infotainment.

* ADAS features are listed in
